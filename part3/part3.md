1. String concatenation was executed instead of adding two integers number, therefore when I tried adding 3+5, it was implementing "3"+"5"=35
2. Use parseInt() to wrap around num1 and num2 individually casts the strings to be integers, and then the addition operator is not doing arithmetic addition as intended instead of string concatenation.
